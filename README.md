## Image Colorization Using Neural Network

### Project Overview

### Problem and Motivation
Before the rise of color photography, images were taken in black and white scale. Much of the ancient history is stored in black and white images which has lost the true essence of time and place. Converting those images into color images can help people feel connected to the historical events stored in photographs. However, most photo editing software are time-consuming and require lot of human interaction.


### Dataset
The Source of Data is “Places365-Standard” dataset by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The link to the data is http://places2.csail.mit.edu/download.html. Data was further cleaned and model was trained on about 20,000 landscape images.
